# freeswitch-config

Freeswitch configuration optimized for [mod_rayo](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_rayo) and [Adhearsion](https://github.com/adhearsion/adhearsion).

## Deployment

### Elastic Beanstalk

This configuration is optimized for deployment on a Amazon Elastic Beanstalk multicontainer docker instance. To deploy this to your own AWS account create an Elastic Beanstalk application and follow the one-time setup instructions below.

#### One-Time Setup

##### Create a new Elastic Beanstalk Application

Create an Elastic Beanstalk single instance application from the AWS web console under your existing VPC (or create a new one). This will give you an Elastic IP address which won't change if you terminate or scale your instances.

##### Configure a S3 bucket to store your FreeSwitch secrets

Adapted from [this blog post].(https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx2B3QUWAA7KOU/How-to-Manage-Secrets-for-Amazon-EC2-Container-Service-Based-Applications-by-Usi)

Sensitive freeswitch configuration such as passwords etc are stored in `freeswitch_secrets.xml` and stored on S3. When the docker container runs the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/dwilkie/freeswitch-config/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh) downloads the configuration before starting freeswitch.

In order for this to work you need to set up an S3 bucket in your AWS account in which to store the secrets and restrict the access to the VPC.

First, create a bucket in S3 using the AWS web console in which to store your secrets.

Next, create a VPC Endpoint to S3. Use the following command following command replacing `<your-aws-profile>` with your configured profile in `~/.aws/credentials`, `VPC_ID` and `ROUTE_TABLE_ID` with the values found in your VPC configuration via the AWS web console and `REGION` with the name of your region e.g. `ap-southeast-1`

```
$ aws ec2 --profile <your-aws-profile> create-vpc-endpoint --vpc-id VPC_ID --route-table-ids ROUTE_TABLE_ID --service-name com.amazonaws.REGION.s3 --region REGION
```

You should see the output similar to the following:

```json
{
  "VpcEndpoint": {
  "PolicyDocument": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":
\"*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}",
  "VpcId": "vpc-1a2b3c4d",
  "State": "available",
  "ServiceName": "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3",
  "RouteTableIds": [
    "rtb-11aa22bb"
  ],
  "VpcEndpointId": "vpce-3ecf2a57",
  "CreationTimestamp": "2016-05-15T09:40:50Z"
  }
}
```

Take note of the `VpcEndpointId` which is required for the next step.

Next, create a file called `policy.json` with the following contents replacing `SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME` with your the name of your new bucket and `VPC_ID` with the `VpcEndpointId` from the previous step.

This policy prevents unencrypted uploads and restricts access to the bucket to the VPC.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": " DenyUnEncryptedInflightOperations",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": false
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-specific-VPCE-only",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [ "s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject" ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:sourceVpce": "VPC_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Next, add the policy to the bucket. Use the following command replacing `SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket.

```
$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --profile <your-aws-profile> --bucket SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME --policy file:////home/user/path/to/policy.json
```

You can check that your policy was uploaded successfully with the following command.

```
$ aws s3api get-bucket-policy --profile <your-aws-profile> --bucket SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, allow your Elastic Beanstalk Instances to access S3. Using the AWS web console, navigate to IAM roles and add a policy to the role `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` to allow Amazon S3 Full Access.

Finally, upload `freeswitch_secrets.xml` to S3 from your EC2 Instance. Note you cannot do this from your development machine because we have already resticted access to the VPC.

```
$ aws s3 cp freeswitch_secrets.xml s3://SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME/freeswitch_secrets.xml --sse
```

When updating secrets, download `freeswitch_secrets.xml` from S3, update the file, reupload it to S3 and re-deploy the application. The following commands are useful:

```
$ aws s3 cp s3://${SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME}/freeswitch_secrets.xml .
$ chmod 600 freeswitch_secrets.xml
$ aws s3 cp freeswitch_secrets.xml s3://SECRETS_BUCKET_NAME/freeswitch_secrets.xml --sse
```

#### Firewall and Networking

[Dockerrun.aws.json](https://github.com/dwilkie/freeswitch-config/blob/master/Dockerrun.aws.json) defines a list of port mappings which map the host to the docker container. Not all of these ports need to be opened in your security group. For example port 8021 is used for `mod_event_socket` but this port should not be opened on in your security group. Depending on your application you may need to open the following ports in your security group:

    udp     16384:32768  (RTP)
    udp     5060         (SIP)
    tcp     5222         (XMPP / Adhearsion)

#### Troubleshooting

If the app fails to deploy the following logs are useful:

* `/var/log/eb-ecs-mgr.log`
* `/var/log/eb-activity.log`

#### FreeSwitch CLI

In order to access the FreeSwitch CLI ssh into your instance, run the docker container which contains FreeSwitch in interactive mode with `/bin/bash`, then from within the container, run the `fs_cli` command specifying the host and password parameters. The host can be found by inspecting the running freeswitch instance's container and the event socket password is in your `freeswitch_secrets.xml`.

The following commands are useful.

```
$ sudo docker ps
$ sudo docker inspect <process_id>
$ sudo docker run -i -t dwilkie/freeswitch-rayo /bin/bash
$ fs_cli -H FREESWITCH_HOST -p EVENT_SOCKET_PASSWORD
```

##### Useful FreeSwitch CLI Commands

Reload SIP Profiles

```
sofia profile external [rescan|reload]
```

Turn on siptrace

```
sofia global siptrace on
```
